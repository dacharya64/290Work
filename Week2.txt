Experiencing VR Content
I used the Oculus Rift to play BattleCon (the tabletop version) on Tabletop Simulator. What I liked about it was that it was interesting to see all the cards laid out visually, and be able to pick up and interact with them. You can pick up cards and flip them. Items like components were accessible from small bags. It was a bit difficult to use the interface, though, because the game consists of a lot of cards with detailed text on them, and it's hard to read and understand what is in front of you in the same way that you would for an actual tabletop game. There were also some issues in the interaction mechanics, where picking up components would accidentally move the table instead. While I don't think that this game was particularly suited to VR, I like the idea of doing something like D&D games in VR where you can have 3d models for environments and animated figurines for players and monsters.
